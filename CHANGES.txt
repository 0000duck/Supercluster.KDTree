Change 1
========
Removed Value Param throughout code base.
Removed "FindValue" methods from KdTree
Added T-Test performance testing.
No statistically significant speed change.


Change 2
========
Removed KdTree and PriorityQueue interfaces.
No statistically significant speed change.


Change 3
========
Removed TypeMath interface and classes. 
Replaced distance calculations with a func. 
Seeing a statistically significant increase in speed.


Change 4
========
Added a unit test for accuracy


Change 5
========
I found the source of the slowness. It was the tree balancing algorithm.
I implemented a construction that uses an expensive full sort during creation
and splits on the median value of dimension. I am not roughly 7.5 times faster on average.
(tree size = 200000, test size = 1000)

Change 6
========
Removed all the add/remove node methods.

Change 7
========
Switched KDTree to an array based implementation. Seeing small statistically significant speed increase.

Change 8
========
Created my own repo to break for dependency.
